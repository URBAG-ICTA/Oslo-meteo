# Oslo-meteo
request.py : This code request data from the Frost API server for meteorological observations in Norway. 
The list of sources available for the Oslo and Viken regions can be obtained from the Read_source.py codes which reads the available sources for these 
two regions in the years 2015 and 2016. All the sources in Oslo are inside the Oslo LCZ ROI, but only the sources in Points_Viken_extracted.csv for Viken 
are inside the ROI.
